Thanks for visiting my notes site and this page.

At school, I helped (actually spoiled) many of my friends by letting them copy my math homework book and made the teachers upset.

At college, I helped/assited the computer lab technician with his work. With earned trust and admin/root rights and more lab hours. Still remember the days I enjoyed by sending wall, net send commands to show off. 

## Favorite books during college
Spend most of the time with books like  `The C programming language` by Dennis Ritchie, `Let Us C and Pointers in C` by Yashavant P. Kanetkar, `TCP/IP Illustrated` by Stevens W. Richard and `The Complete Reference of RedHat`.
