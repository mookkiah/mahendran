## Unistalling JDK
We may have installed JDK using different ways. Meaning `manually` download dmg and install, via `brew install` command or via `brew cask install`
To see if it is installed using brew, use `brew list` command.
To view details about a package `brew info <package>` command

```
$ brew list
adoptopenjdk11  
$ brew info adoptopenjdk11
adoptopenjdk11: 11.0.9.1,1
https://adoptopenjdk.net/
/usr/local/Caskroom/adoptopenjdk11/11.0.5,10 (180.3MB)
From: https://github.com/adoptopenjdk/homebrew-openjdk/blob/HEAD/Casks/adoptopenjdk11.rb
==> Name
AdoptOpenJDK 11
==> Description
AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK (Java) Development Kit
==> Artifacts
OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.pkg (Pkg)
```


Once we know it is installed via brew, we can unistall using `brew uninstall <package>` command
```
$ brew uninstall adoptopenjdk
==> Uninstalling Cask adoptopenjdk
==> Removing directories if empty:
Warning: Skipping rmdir for undeletable path '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines'.
==> Backing Generic Artifact 'adoptopenjdk-12.0.1.jdk' up to '/usr/local/Caskroom/adoptopenjdk/12.0.1,12/jdk-12.0.1+12'.
Password:
==> Removing Generic Artifact '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-12.0.1.jdk'.
==> Purging files for version 12.0.1,12 of Cask adoptopenjdk
```

Uninstall will fail if any dependency on this package (formulae and casks) and you know what you are doing, you may need to force by ignoring dependencies
```
$ brew uninstall openjdk --ignore-dependencies
Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/15.0.1... (614 files, 324.0MB)
```
