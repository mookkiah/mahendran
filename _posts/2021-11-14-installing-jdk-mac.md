# Multiple ways
Multiple implementors of JDK gives multiple options to instlall JDK for each operating system.
In all those installations JDK contents extracted into a directory which makes more sense for the operating system. We can also download the compressed content and extract. It is recommended to choose an approach and stick with it while installing multiple version.

Here are few ways I know of installing JDK
- Extract zip/tgz
- Commandline install using brew
- Commandline install using sdkman
- GUI install using package

Most prefered/recommended way is the operating system way for end user/developer. Which usually download the package from the JDK vendor and installing with user interface. For Windows, installer executable, for linux yum/rpm packages, for mac app package.

I use brew to install all development related tools/library/kit. So I decided to use it for JDK install as well.

Mac places the Java Virtual Machines under `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` folder when installing as mac application. If we are using any other approach, installation recommends us to create symlink to this folder if it installs in other directory.

Here is two output which you can understand this
```shell
$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V

Here I installed OpenJDK 11 using homebrew.

```
Here I installed OpenJDK 18 using Homebrew. During the install it asked me to symblink (`sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk`). I dont like the fact that recommendation not specific to version 18.



  While you have multiple options to install JDK, Choose the one which you are familiar. If first time choose the operating system way. 

## Installing JDK 11 using brew
```shell
mahendran@mm-lab mahendran % brew install openjdk@11
mahendran@mm-lab mahendran % export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v11);
mahendran@mm-lab mahendran % java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 11.0.12+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 11.0.12+0, mixed mode)
```


## Installing JDK 17 using brew cask
OpenJDK distributions from AdoptOpenJDK now called `Eclipse Temurin`

```shell
mahendran@mm-lab mahendran % brew install --cask temurin

## Unistalling JDK
We may have installed JDK using different ways. Meaning `manually` download dmg and install, via `brew install` command or via `brew cask install`
To see if it is installed using brew, use `brew list` command.
To view details about a package `brew info <package>` command

```
$ brew list
adoptopenjdk11  
$ brew info adoptopenjdk11
adoptopenjdk11: 11.0.9.1,1
https://adoptopenjdk.net/
/usr/local/Caskroom/adoptopenjdk11/11.0.5,10 (180.3MB)
From: https://github.com/adoptopenjdk/homebrew-openjdk/blob/HEAD/Casks/adoptopenjdk11.rb
==> Name
AdoptOpenJDK 11
==> Description
AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK (Java) Development Kit
==> Artifacts
OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.9.1_1.pkg (Pkg)
```


Once we know it is installed via brew, we can unistall using `brew uninstall <package>` command
```
$ brew uninstall adoptopenjdk
==> Uninstalling Cask adoptopenjdk
==> Removing directories if empty:
Warning: Skipping rmdir for undeletable path '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines'.
==> Backing Generic Artifact 'adoptopenjdk-12.0.1.jdk' up to '/usr/local/Caskroom/adoptopenjdk/12.0.1,12/jdk-12.0.1+12'.
Password:
==> Removing Generic Artifact '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-12.0.1.jdk'.
==> Purging files for version 12.0.1,12 of Cask adoptopenjdk
```

Uninstall will fail if any dependency on this package (formulae and casks) and you know what you are doing, you may need to force by ignoring dependencies
```
$ brew uninstall openjdk --ignore-dependencies
Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/15.0.1... (614 files, 324.0MB)
```
