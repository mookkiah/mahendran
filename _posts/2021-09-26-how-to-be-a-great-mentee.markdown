During school days, we followed discipline and showed much respect to teachers. Teachers want to see their students gain more knowledge and dream of growing better than themselves. They are always proud to say, "That is my student!"

Once we are out of school, we start forgetting how to respect someone who shares their knowledge and, more importantly, their time to help us grow.

A mentor is someone who is willing to invest their time and energy into helping someone else achieve their goals. They do this by sharing their experience, wisdom, and knowledge, and by providing guidance and support. A good mentor is someone who is patient, understanding, and non-judgmental. They are also someone who is passionate about helping others succeed.

## Who are our mentors
After schooling, we all find mentors either by assignment (supervisor/manager) or by knowing someone who is great at their work (role model/expert). Sometimes, we find mentors who are popular and try to follow their style. We may also work with paid mentors, such as health advisors, financial advisors, or career coaches.

We can categorize these mentors into two main types - formal mentor and informal mentor.

## Informal mentor
Informal mentor someone we...
- might not know in person
- don't meet regularly
- might not ever talk (forum/radio/tv)
- don't get feedback
- don't have to give commitments

There is not much that you need to do when having an informal mentor, except following their principles/advice or, these days, following them on social media. 
We may also recommend other friends to follow them.


## Formal mentor
Formal mentor is someone we
- know and respect them well.
- know about and agrees with expectations.
- may have regularly scheduled sessions.
- look for long term relationship.

Here are my learnings on how to be a great mentee while working with a formal mentor, so you can give them the same happiness our teachers had.

### Ground rules for working with formal mentor:
To get the most out of your mentor's time and to become a better mentee, follow these ground rules as much as you can:

- `Be prepared for your meetings.` This means coming to meetings with questions, goals, and an agenda.
- `Do not miss meetings because you feel unprepared.` If you are feeling unprepared, reach out to your mentor and reschedule the meeting.
- `Let your mentor know when you cannot meet.` This gives them time to adjust their schedule and to make sure that they are available when you need them.
- `Follow up on tasks, even if they are hard.` This shows that you are committed to your goals and that you are willing to put in the work.
- `Gracefully accept direction and criticism.` This shows that you are open to learning and that you are willing to grow.
- `Be honest with yourself and your mentor.` This means being honest about your strengths, weaknesses, and goals.
- `Pay for your own expenses.` This shows that you are committed to the relationship and that you are willing to invest in yourself.
- `Use a mentoring journal.` This will help you to track your progress and to reflect on your learning.
- `Pay them on time if it is a paid mentorship.` This shows that you are respectful of their time and that you appreciate their help.



### Optimize meetings and communication with mentor
Always remember that your mentor's time is more valuable than yours. Here are a few tips to optimize communication with your mentor so they enjoy mentoring you:



- Meeting etiquette to follow
	- Show up early.
	- DO NOT check your phone.
	- Be present.
	- Dress appropriately.
	- Be concise and stay on task.
	- Don't talk over your mentor.
	- Food is not the focus.
	- Don't let your eyes drift - Make sure your body language says you are there and you are into it.
	- Stay until the end.
- Active listening
    - Listen more and talk less.
	- Take notes effectively.
	- Summary the main points.
	- Summarize action items.


## Never ever frustrate your mentor
You may have seen doctor office posters stating these:

- "I don't understand why you're paying me to give advice that you don't follow."
- "If you believe your Google search is giving you better solutions to your health problems, why are you here?"

These posters may seem funny, but they could be a sample of the frustration that mentors feel when their mentees don't follow their advice. Don't let your mentor have similar thoughts.

## Closing comment
Be thankful for having a mentor and respect them as if they were your teacher, as they can help lay the foundation for your growth. Show your respect and make them proud of you by following meeting etiquette and listening actively. Remember that it is hard to find a good mentor like your favorite teacher, but it is easy to miss one.
