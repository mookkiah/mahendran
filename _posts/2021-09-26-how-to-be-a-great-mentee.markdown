During school days, we followed discipline and gave much respect to teachers. Teachers are the one who wants to see their students to gain more knowledge than they dream about grow us better than themselves. They always proud of saying "That is my student!!!".

Once we are out of school, we started forgetting about how to respect someone who shares their knowledge more importantly their time to groom us better.

A mentor enjoys the opportunity to share experience, wisdom, and knowledge while a mentee shows interest to gain a foundation for building skills and meeting goals. 

## How we find a mentor
After schooling we all find a mentors either by assignment (supervisor/manager) or by knowing someone doing great at their work (role model / expert). Sometime we find mentors who are popular and try to practice their style. Maybe we may work with a paid mentors like health advisor, financial advisor or career coach.

We can categorize these mentors into two types - formal mentor and informal mentor.

## Informal Mentor
Informal mentor someone we...
- might not know in person
- don't meet regularly
- might not ever talk (forum/radio/tv)
- don't get feedback
- don't have to give commitments

There is not much to follow when having informal mentor except following their principles/advice or these days following them in social media.
We may recommend other friends to follow them.


## Formal Mentor
Formal mentor is someone we
- know and respect them well
- know about and agrees with expectations
- may have regularly scheduled sessions
- look for long term relationship

Here are my learning on how to be a great mentee while working with formal mentor so you can give them the same happiness our teachers had.

### Ground rules for working with formal mentor:
Have these ground rules and follow them as much as you can.

I will ...
- be prepared for my meetings
- not miss meetings because I feel unprepared
- let my mentor know when I cannot meet
- follow-up on tasks, even if they are hard
- gracefully accept direction and criticism
- be honest with myself and my mentor
- pay for my own expense
- use a mentoring journal
- pay them ontime if it is a paid mentorship


### Optimize meetings and communication with mentor
Always remember your mentor's time is more valuable than your's. Here are few tips to optimize the communication with your mentor so he/she enjoys mentoring you.

- Meeting etiquette to follow
	- Show up early
	- DO NOT check your phone
	- Be present
	- Dress appropriately
	- Be concise and stay on task
	- Don't talk over your mentor
	- Don't be rude to others
	- Food is not the focus
	- Don't let your eyes drift - Make sure your body language says you are there and you are into it. Eye contact.
	- Stay until the end
- Active listening
	- Appropriate eye contact
	- Effective note taking
	- Summary of main points
	- Summarize action items



I have seen doctor office posters stating these...
- I don't understand why are you paying me to give advices which you don't follow.
- If you believe your google search is giving better solution to your health problems, why are you here? 

These are the sample frustration when a mentee is not following the mentor. Don't let your mentor have similar thoughts.

## Closing comment
Be thankful for having a mentor and respect them as if they are your teacher and who can help set foundation for your growth. Show your respect and have them proud of you by following the meeting etiquette and listening actively. Remember it is hard to find good mentor like your favorite teacher but easy to miss one.
