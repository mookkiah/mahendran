# Motivation
I started sharing my learning as notes in mm-notes.com. Many posts has code snippet or logs which are commentable by readers. Its good to get feedback and update the notes to make it more usable.
As github pages does not give opportunity to record it at the post level. Also, there are better ways to highlight the code snippet specific to language. GitHub Gist offers the option to comment, allows easy insertion of images and code formatting. 

## Hello World Gist
