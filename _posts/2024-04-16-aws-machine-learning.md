# AWS Machine Learning

If you dont have business problem, then you can't possibiliy come up with machine learning algorithm and model to answer what you are trying figure out.

## Terminology

### What is a model?

Model is a `trained algorithm` which is

- Used to identify patterns in your data, and
- Does not require explicit, manually set rules.

### Supervised

Learn by identifying data that is `already been labeled`. We have/had data to train

Classification:

- Binary (Yes or No)
- Multiclass Classfication (like tags. Ex: possible answers for call center - "IT Support", "Returns", "Accounting")
- Regression problem (Range)

### Unsupervised

There is no existing data points to train. We just have raw data. The machine has to uncover and `create the labels` itself.

- use data grouping.
- detects annomolies.

### Reinforcement Learning

Learning through trial and error.
